                  <p> It had been hard for me to get my property occupied until I found AirBNB Optimal Pricing. I would go weeks without receiving any hits on my listing! I tried to use similar properties as a reference price, but I was not able to appreciate the intracacies of what goes into listing at a good price.

                  <p> AirBNB was something that appealed to me as soon as I discovered it. I quickly became a frequent user. The more I used, the more I encountered highly overvalued stays. Once I found AirBNB Optimal Pricing I was able to solve this problem! I now make sure that what I am paying is not far off from the optimal price given a location's features.  - John Smith</p><br>
